# Usage

It's recommnded to use `toggleboard.py` from the terminal.

    cd <location>
    python toggleboard.py

# Testing

Since many errors are silenced with python's try except syntax
I allow for an optional argument, `--debug`, to be passed into 
`toggleboard.py`, like so:

    python toggleboard.py --debug

You can also pass in `--test` to initiate some internal 
class method and function tests to ensure the program is
working correctly, and can handle bad input elegantly.

# Controls

To use WASD controls instead of coordinate input, use
--control-wasd, like so:

    python toggleboard.py --control-wasd/--control-coord

## Basic Design

The game uses a couple of important classes

- `Constants` handles most game data and is initalized globally
 as constants

- `GridPoint` is an x,y type object. For example:
      gp = GridPoint(10,11)
      gp.x - gp.y
      > -1
  It also has some helper methods and overloads adding and printing.
  I use it for sizes also, so I can access the sizes with x and y

- `InputManager()` handles all input. Ensure `constants.InputType` is set correctly

- `Board()` is an important class that handles point flipping and knowing when the
  board is done. Go read it to understand!

- `Game()` contains the main game loop and error handling, as well as a nice 
  little easter egg: when you say oui to the first question, when you win 
  you get a queen song!

- `smart_input` is a sweet little function I wrote to handle input 
  by passing in some functions. It trys to transform the input and
  if it fails just asks again.

  I should write a better one that allows changing the context, 
  but it wasn't neccessary for this project
